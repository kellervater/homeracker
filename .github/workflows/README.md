# GitHub Workflows

This directory contains automated workflows for the HomeRacker repository.

## Workflows

### 1. Handle Release PRs (`release-please.yml`)
Creates and updates release PRs based on conventional commits. The release PR accumulates all changes until it gets merged.

**Triggers:** Push to `main` branch

**Requirements:** GitHub App credentials

### 2. Automerge Release PRs (`automerge-release.yml`)
Automatically merges release PRs on a schedule. This is what triggers the release PR to be merged and creates the actual release.

**Triggers:** 
- Weekly schedule
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Requirements:** GitHub App credentials

### 3. Validate PR Title (`validate-pr-title.yml`)
Validates PR titles against Conventional Commits format to prevent broken releases when using "Squash & Merge".

**Triggers:** PR opened, edited, synchronize, or reopened

**Requirements:** None (uses default `github.token`)

## GitHub App Setup

The release and automerge workflows require a GitHub App with the following permissions:
- Contents: Read & Write
- Pull Requests: Read & Write

### Required Repository Secrets

Configure these secrets in your repository settings:

1. `RELEASES_APP_ID` - The GitHub App ID
2. `RELEASES_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` - The GitHub App private key

### Why a GitHub App?

A GitHub App is required to allow subsequent workflow runs to be triggered by the release workflows. The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` has limitations that prevent workflow-triggered events from starting new workflows.
