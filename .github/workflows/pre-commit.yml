# Using both pull_request and pull_request_target triggers to support:
# - pull_request: Regular contributors (may require approval based on repo settings)
# - pull_request_target: Renovate bot (runs without requiring approval)
# Security: Explicitly checks out PR head SHA to test actual PR code while
# maintaining read-only permissions (no secrets usage).
