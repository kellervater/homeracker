This script is intended to be used with the Fusion360 file `HomeRacker - Shelf`.
It exports all sane dimensions of the shelf to avoid tedious manual work. 
It is ready to go and just needs to be run from within Fusion360 (`Shift + S`).

> [!NOTE]
> Since I bootstrapped the script from within Fusion, idk how to import it. Maybe you need to create a new one and just import the contents. Just try it and let me know how it works.
